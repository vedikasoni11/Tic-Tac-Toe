Tic Tac Toe Game
Overview
This is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players to play alternately on the same device. It includes a responsive user interface and keeps track of the game's progress to determine the winner or a draw.

Winner Detection: Automatically checks for a winner after each turn.
Restart Option: Allows players to reset the game and start over.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure and layout of the game.
CSS: Styling and visual effects.
JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.

How to Play
Open the game in a web browser.
Player 1 (O) starts the game by clicking on a square.
Player 2 (X) takes their turn by clicking on an empty square.

The game alternates turns until:
One player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal (winner).
All squares are filled, and no player has won (draw).

Click the "Reset" button to play again.
